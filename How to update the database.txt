AdjustedCostIndexes - Update with this script: F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\API Stuff\Import into AdjustedCostIndex.py

These 3 tables are updated with this script: F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Static Data\Parse Static Data into DB.py
BlueprintActivityMaterialRequirements
BlueprintActivityProductionAmounts
BlueprintActivityTimes
Run the script whenever a new SDE drops. It updates the Items table too.

Distances - This runs on old data from fuzzworks and will eventually need the data gotten from the SDE.
Obviously, the gate networks don't get updated often, so this can probably wait a while before I
have to figure out how to pulll the data from the SDE download and format at it like fuzzworks did.
Run these scripts:
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Distances\Distances distanceAmarr.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Distances\Distances distanceDodixie.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Distances\Distances distanceHek.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Distances\Distances distanceHomeAndContiguousHighsec.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Distances\Distances distanceJita.py

EstimatedRegionalHighSellAmount - this is a derivative table that needs to be updated whenever the OrderHistory
table gets updated. I'm guessing you run this script:
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Market Processing\EstimateRegionalHighSellAmount.py

IndustryActivityMaterials - I have been unable to find where this is used in my program and don't know how to update it.
IndustryActivitySkills - This actually isn't used
InventionInputsAndProbabilities - This isn't used either
ItemReprocessingOutputs - Unused

Items - This table is updated at the same time as the 3 Blueprint tables. Update it with this script whenever a new SDE drops:
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Static Data\Parse Static Data into DB.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Update Items with ActivityID.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Find blueprints for items.py

MarketOrdersAll - This should be updated every day or two.
This script takes like 3 hours: F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\API Stuff\Import into Market Orders db.py
There is another script that exports the data to a csv and only takes like 45 minutes, but I don't remember where it is.
Afterwards these scripts need to be run to update the distances of each order. I think they take 5 or 10 minutes each:
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Market Processing\MarketOrdersAll distanceAmarr.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Market Processing\MarketOrdersAll distanceDodixie.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Market Processing\MarketOrdersAll distanceHek.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Market Processing\MarketOrdersAll distanceHomeAndContiguousHighsec.py
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Market Processing\MarketOrdersAll distanceJita.py

MaxProductionLimits - This is updated with the same script as the Items table.

OnHandMaterials - This is unused

OrderHistory - Update with this. It takes 36 hours:
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\API Stuff\Import OrderHistory into csv.py

Alternatively, Shasokas Tour has a script that pulls order history.
I pay him 100 mil each week for the data. If you ask him, he'd probably give/sell it to you as well.

Then Import the data into the database from the csv:
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\API Stuff\Import OrderHistroy from csv into db.py

This script analyzes the order history data to estimate how many of an item goes for the sell price in a specific region per day:
F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Market Processing\OrderHistory Avg Highest and Avg Volume.py

PackagedItemVolumes - This is unused
PurchaseOrders - This is unused

Recipes - Update with this query and script. It takes about 36 minutes:
Run this sql query: F:\Eve Cost Analysis\Queries\Insert into Recipes from Items.sql
Then run this python script F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\Production\GenerateDatabaseRecipes.py

Regions - Relies on data from fuzzworks, but doesn't really need much updating for obvious reasons
Reports - Unused

SolarSystemJumps - Also relies on data from fuzzworks
SolarSystems - Relies on data from fuzzworks
Stations - Relies on data from fuzzworks


SystemCostIndexes - F:\Eve Cost Analysis\scripts\API Stuff\2 - API call to db - SystemCostIndex.py
