Query the items table for each typeID that has a blueprint.
For each typeID look into the EstimatedRegionalHighSellAmount table
 and get the volume_high amount for each region. If all regions are 0
 move to the next typeID. Hold the columns that had values above 0
 in memory.
For each region whose volume_high value was above 0, compute how much
 it would cost to build the item and its sub components using materials
 on the market. Take into account whether it would be cheaper to buy
 expensive materials at the market vs buying cheaper ones at another hub
 and getting them shipped over. Take volume into consideration when
 planning shipping and make a preference for DSTs for trips between
 Amarr and Jita. There is a configuration setting to ignore hauling costs.
 If that setting is true, then skip the hauling calculation.
